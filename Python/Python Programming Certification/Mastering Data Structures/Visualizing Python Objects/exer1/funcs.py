"""
Functions demonstrating using other functions as parameters.

These two functions are implementations of the famous fold functions.  A variation of
fold is called "reduce", which is part of Google's famous map-reduce set-up.

def fold_left(f, seq, value):
    """
    Returns the result of folding f left over seq, starting with value.

    To fold a function f from the left, we
    * Start with value in the accumulator
    * Iterate over the sequence normally
    * At each step, apply f to the accumulator and the next element
    * After applying f, make the new value the accumulator

    Example: Suppose f is - (subtraction), seq is (1,2,3,4) and value is 0.  Then
    the result is

        ((((0-1)-2)-3)-4) = -10

    Parameter f: the function to fold
    Precondition: f is a function that takes two arguments of the same time, and
    returning a value of the same type

    Parameter seq: the sequence to fold
    Precondition: seq is a sequence (tuple, string, etc.) whose elements are the
    same type as that returned by f

    Parameter value: the initial starting value
    Precondition: value has the same type as the return type of f
